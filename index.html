        <h2>How powerful are they?</h2>
        <p>Well these cats are one of the most powerful land animals on the planet as well as being the largest living cat species. They can get up to 12 ft long counting the tail, and can weigh up to 800 pounds. They're so big that they are unable to climb trees because they are often to heavy for the tree. They also have extreme muscle density and can perform feats that would seem pretty crazy for a human or most other animals for that matter. Their paw swipes are so powerful that if a tiger hit you in the head with its paw, it would shatter your skull! </p>

<h3>they are very versitile cats.</h3>
<p>They can swim, they can climb(if the tree is big and stable enough), and they can hunt in the day and the night. Though they are nocturnal, they also have superb night vision, about 7 times better than a humans night vision to compare, they can see in the dark about as well as we can see in the day. they also prefer to ambush prey after stalking it, all that power but not very high stamina, which makes sense.</p>
